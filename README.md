# Create account

In order to run this script, you will need auth codes which we provide manually to volunteers with account credits.

Simply rename `config.example.js` to `config.js` and add account and relevant active keys and auth codes, which we will issue.

Run script every 10 or 20 minutes with cron task.

`yarn`

`node index.js`
